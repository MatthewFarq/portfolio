            <p>
                With social media now being the primary medium for individuals and organizations to network and promote their brand, they need a platform that allows them to manage and share content on all of their social networks from one location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kudu is essentially a cloud storage/social media management highbred. Users can manage digital assets, and post to various networks all at once. Additionally, users can engage with their social network streams, manage their direct messages, and view simple analytics to track the activity of their shared content.

        <h2>Getting up to speed</h2>
        <p>For my second project as a Product Design student at Thinkful, I was given a client brief that asked me to explore the cloud storage and organization market. Although the client recognized that there are currently some big-name competitors in the space, they felt that the market is still young and that there is room for another player as long as we find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience. While the brief wanted me to include basic features found in typical cloud storage apps such as storing, organizing, and sharing content; the client left the project very open for me to explore and research the market.</p>

        <h2>A moment of reflection</h2>
        <p>Prior to gathering data and finding trends through a survey, I knew that I needed to have an established goal in mind. As a former violinist, online sales representative, and video game streamer wannabe, I became interested in how content creators managed their content, networked with their community, and promoted their brand.</p>

            <h2>Problem – The struggle is real</h2>
            <p>
                To assist in validating this potential direction, I spoke with friends who were freelancing musicians, photographers, composers, and producers. By speaking with musicians, photographers, composers, and producers, I became aware of a couple of common frustrations:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>It’s difficult for digital content creators to be organized.</li>
                <li>It takes too much time for content creators to share their brand with all of their social networks.</li>

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Establish a cloud storage system that feels familiar to the user.</li>

                    As a social media management platform, Hootsuite felt more like a direct threat to my platform. In a nutshell, Hootsuite allows users to conveniently utilize multiple social network accounts from one location and to view detailed analytics of a network or social media post performance across channels. This is where I needed to determine what they’re doing that I should do, and how they are falling short.

                    Because I was trying to solve a different problem to what Google Drive is meant for, I looked to Google Drive more for inspiration on what they were doing well rather than how they could improve. Because I already knew that my users were already fluent with Google Drive’s interface, I wanted to emulate a similar experience so my users would feel at home on my platform.

        <h2>But wait, why the name Kudu?</h2>
        <p>
            With my wife being from South Africa, I had the pleasure of being able to visit her family in Cape Town in 2014. This is where I was first introduced to a Kudu, an African deer. Not only did I love the way they looked, but I also just liked saying the word Kudu. It’s a simple four-letter name that represents an animal that not too many people are familiar with. While I was exploring this name, I thought of brands like Puma, Acorns, Grasshopper, and even Apple. After learning that Steve jobs chose the name Apple while being on a fruit diet and simply liked the way apple sounded, I realized that was enough validation for me to run with the name Kudu.

            Now that I had a name and a logo, I needed to determine what kind of emotions I wanted to convey to the users. While other social media management platforms have a very corporate feeling, Kudu needed to feel approachable, serious, clean, and simple. For this project I wanted to incorporate a monochromatic color scheme. I decided to make most of the app white while the logo and some other elements would be deep blue to create a strong contrast.

                I first chose Futura for my branding typography because it looks great next to the logo and it added just the right amount of simplicity and playfulness. I determined that Futura would be used for all branding content as well as some of the larger text.

                For the main content I chose to use Lato for its legibility as smaller text and the way it nicely compliments Futura.

            After reviewing the information architecture and space economy, I realized that the main content needed more room to breathe. In addition to this claustrophobic feeling, the top of the screen had two much-unused space along with an excessively large search bar. To resolve this issue, I moved the navbar to the top of the page and replaced tab names with simple icons. This improved the hierarchy and overall energy of all of the pages of the app.

            Kudu was finally coming to life and it started to feel like a beautiful solution to the problem I was attempting to solve. Aside from improving the explanation of what the product is on the marketing page, the biggest failure that needed to be addressed was the “New Post” button in the web version. Some users found the button difficult to locate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of this, I decided to change the color of the “New post” button to green to improve its visual hierarchy as a primary call to action on every page of the app.

        <p>
            Of the many things that I learned from this project, the main takeaway for me was the importance of trusting the design process. Although I had hunches and predictions, I learned to trust my research and allow the evidence to guide my design decisions. Through my research, I was able to tackle the project brief and identify a problem that needed to be explored with a particular audience. Overall, I’m very proud of the solution that Kudu turned out to be. It is a unique product that solves an important problem in a growing market.

                    While the violin will always have a special place in my
                    heart, it wasn’t until I was pursuing a Masters at Boston
                    Conservatory that I began to reevaluate what I wanted in a
                    professional career. <strong>Through my musical background, I
                    learned what it takes to pour myself into my work and to
                    empathise with the human experience through music.</strong> I began
                    to develop a craving to challenge my personal biases with
                    solid evidence and facts. This, and a fascination with the
                    growing tech industry, ignited an interest in the incredible
                    world of UX. As a musician who always found value in
                    studying the market, <strong>I saw UX design as a means of designing
                    beautifully viable products.</strong>

                    My new perspective pulled me to change the direction that my
                    career was going. Within a year, I left Boston Conservatory,
                    my wife and I purchased a house in Minneapolis and soon
                    adopted a beautiful golden retriever puppy named Charlie
                    Parker. My wife got a job as a software developer at Best
                    Buy, and I got a job at a local music store while I began
                    taking steps towards a career in UX.

                    While working as the primary sales representative at the
                    music store, it was my responsibility to create online
                    product listings on Amazon and Reverb, and to assist all
                    customers. While answering questions about products with
                    potential customers, I eventually became more and more
                    familiar with common questions that prevented customers from
                    simply purchasing the item online without any assistance. I
                    made it my goal to design flawless product listings with all
                    of the necessary information to enable customers to make the
                    purchase. Shortly after doing this, <strong>the music shop experienced
                    a significant increase in online sales.</strong> This experience encouraged me to 
                    take the necessary steps to achieve a career as a UX/UI designer.

                    Aside from UX, I enjoy playing with my dog, practicing yoga,
                    and cooking and eating delicious food with my wife. I also
                    enjoy traveling and reading books that challenge how I think
                    about the world.
